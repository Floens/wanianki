Exports WaniKani content to Anki.

Crawls the WaniKani content and exports it to a CSV and audio, that can be imported in an Anki deck.

Note: your progress will not be carried over to the Anki deck.

Setup:
Use at least Python 3.6
pip install beautifulsoup4 requests
copy config.ini.sample to config.ini and fill it in
run main.py

It downloads all pages and audio, and then extracts the data from it. This takes about 3 hours.
The result is a csv file and mp3 files. These can be imported in Anki. See the ANKI file for the fields and HTML templates.


Technical note:
It downloads all html pages to later extract the data from them because the API is not sufficient and misses some important data.
The extraction of data from the html is very error-prone and might break. If WK changes some of their rendering it might break, please provide a PR if that happens.
